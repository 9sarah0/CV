## About me
My name is Sara, and I am an Engineer. I imagine, I believe, I collaborate, I plan, I execute and I build. I have a passion for making a difference and for improving people's quality of life.

Driven by the goal of helping patients with [Muscular Dystrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy), together with my university senior project partner we designed a Brain Computer Interface that enables the patient to navigate his wheelchair simply by thinking the direction of the navigation desired. We were very proud of our project's results where the average accuracy of the system is 91% on the overall and as high as 97.5% for some users.

Working on that project landed me my first job as a Biomedical Engineer. There were a lot of fault detection and diagnosis, preventive maintenance, and end-user demonstration and training. All of that was great, but then it just became routine. And since it was not a manufacturer company, they didn't have a research and development department and that did not indulge my desire to make an impact on people's lives.

Although the university program had only a few number of code related courses, I developed a passion for coding. It blew my mind the number of potential things I could be doing with this superpower. It is beyond question the impact of software applications on people's lives. One of the main decisions in my life that led to where and who I am now was quitting my job to join [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) (a highly selective 16 weeks intensive coding course). Today, having completed MA course I can't wait to get my first role as a junior developer and start building cool applications following the best practices I've been learning the past four months.

## Skills

#### Working With others

I adapt easily while working with other pair-partners or team members.
- I've been doing pair programing for three months while studying at makers academy in addition to working with teams on three projects.
- I was involved in organizing several events while being IEEE-WIE Chairwoman, which required continuos communication with different teams and people.


#### Calm Under Pressure

Be it meeting a deadline, learning something completely new, or working out of my comfort zone, I can keep my work efficiency.
- During my work as a biomedical engineer I used to give end user demonstrations and trainings on equipments that were new to me while covering for other absent engineers. Doing that required to fit the training sessions in my busy schedule and to learn about the application of the equipment and be prepared to teach some one how to use it (sometimes with only one day notice).
- Together with my university senior project partner, we decided to finish the project which normally takes two semesters, in one semester. Although the time was very tight compered to most of the other teams, we not only managed to finish it on time, but we earned the Best Senior Project Award of that semester.


#### Committed / Self-motivated

Whenever I take a decision I am always all in.
- I did Makers Academy Ronin course, which is the remote option. Even though studying remotely has its advantages, you lose the motivating atmosphere of a class room. And to be in front of a computer for more that 9 hours every day of the week takes serious commitment and motivation.


#### Software Development

Coming from an engineering background, and being at Makers Academy for 16-weeks doing intensive coding every day from 9 am to 6 pm I have developed essential software development skills.

- I was following TDD for the development of all my projects in MA.
- I built a good understanding and practice of extreme programing values.
- I've been taught Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, Javascript and much more, in witch I used to build exciting web-apps. I've included two of my [projects](#projects) in this cv, however you can view more [here](https://github.com/9sarah0?tab=repositories).
- On top of the technologies that I studied at makers, [two of my projects were](#projects) done using new technologies. Together with my two teams, we managed to learn the technologies and deliver a respectful MVP.

## Reviews
Here is what my final project team thought of me:

_"Sara picks up new tech extremely quickly, and she is very good at managing an approach to solving problems"_ - [Ross Hamilton](https://github.com/SlipperyJ)

_"Very quickly adapted to a new language (java) and applied syntax"_ - [Robert Summers](https://github.com/Rob-rls)

_"Great teacher / communication skills"_ - [Alban Allen](https://github.com/albiebabie)
