## About me
Beginning career Electronics Engineer who is active, involved, and passionate about programming and desires a career focused in the field. Young, yet hard-working experienced programming in researching and web development. It was whilst studying at university, that I discovered coding and that I wanted to find out more. That's why I recently decided to quit my job as a Biomedical Engineer and join the Makers Academy 16 weeks intensive coding course.

## Highlights
- **Web Developer Bootcamp:** Makers Academy (2016)
- **Work experience:** Biomedical Engineer (2014-2016)
- **International Award:** Nasser Bin Hamad International Award (Science Category) â€“ Third Place: Brain Computer Interface for Wheelchair (2016).
- **Published Research:** [SubBand-Power-Based Efficient Brain Computer Interface for Wheelchair Control](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6916840/), American Journal of Signal Processing, (2014)
- **Chairwoman IEEE / WIE:** Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Bahrain Section, Women in Engineering. (2013-2014)
- **BSc. Electronics Engineering:** University of Bahrain (2008-2013)
- **Freelance Tutor to University Engineering Students:** Courses: Logic Design 1 & 2, C++, Microprocessors, and Computer Organization (2010-2015)



## Skills

#### Working With others

I adapt easily while working with other pair-partners or team members.
- I've been doing pair programing for three months while studying at makers academy in addition to working with teams on three projects.
- I was involved in organizing several events while being IEEE-WIE Chairwoman, which required continuos communication with different teams and people.


#### Calm Under Pressure

Be it meeting a deadline, learning something completely new, or working out of my comfort zone, I can keep my work efficiency.
- During my work as a biomedical engineer I used to give end user demonstrations and trainings on equipments that were new to me while covering for other absent engineers. Doing that required to fit the training sessions in my busy schedule and to learn about the application of the equipment and be prepared to teach some one how to use it (sometimes with only one day notice).
- Together with my university senior project partner, we decided to finish the project which normally takes two semesters, in one semester. Although the time was very tight compered to most of the other teams, we not only managed to finish it on time, but we earned the Best Senior Project Award of that semester.


#### Committed / Self-motivated

Whenever I take a decision I am always all in.
- I did Makers Academy Ronin course, which is the remote option. Even though studying remotely has its advantages, you lose the motivating atmosphere of a class room. And to be in front of a computer for more that 9 hours every day of the week takes serious commitment and responsibility.


#### Software Development

Coming from an engineering background, and being at Makers Academy for 16-weeks doing intensive coding every day from 9 am to 6 pm I have developed essential software development skills.

- I was following TDD for the development of all my projects in MA.
- I built a good understanding and practice of extreme programing values.
- I've been taught Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, Javascript and much more, in witch I used to build exciting web-apps. I've included two of my [projects](#projects) in this cv, however you can view more [here](https://github.com/9sarah0?tab=repositories).
- On top of the technologies that I studied at makers, [two of my projects were](#projects) done using new technologies. Together with my two teams, we managed to learn the technologies and deliver a respectful MVP.

| [Volunteer Matcher](https://github.com/arukomp/volunteer-matcher) |5| A job board for voluntary opportunities including a rewards scheme | Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB | Mocha, Chai, Zombie|-We had only 3 and a half days to work on the project. <br>  -Most of the technologies used were new to us including non-relational databases |


## Education

#### Makers Academy (June to September 2016)

- Curiosity and hungry passion for code
- Independent learner and problem-solver
- OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC, DDD
- Software Craftsmanship
- Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node.js
- Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha

#### University of Bahrain (September 2008 to January 2013)
- BSc. Electronic Engineering
- Best Senior Project Award:
  - Brain Signal Sensing Applied to Smart Wheel Chair Actuation for Disabled People.
   - Implementation of the concept of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) using wireless EEG-headset
   - Signal processing to achieve the objective of classifying the EEG signals into 4 classes of thoughts: thinking forward, reverse, right, and left.
   - All the signal processing was done with MATLAB.
   - Ultimately, the classifier is used to wirelessly control a wheelchair.
